                When it comes to chicken there just isn’t anything more delicious than a juicy, crusty piece of finger-licking good fried chicken. It might seem intimidating to fry your own chicken, but it’s actually pretty straightforward and it puts grocery store and fast food fried chicken to shame.  If you have a thermometer for the oil and a timer, you can produce fail-proof fried chicken.  If you’ve ever wanted to make your own fried chicken, now is the time to try!

            <h2 id="beef">Beef</h2>
            <p class="recipe">
                This is just an excellent beef steak marinade that adds juiciness and flavour into steaks, transforming economical steaks from just ok to “wow!”. It injects extra flavour without overpowering the natural flavour of beef, and makes the meat tender.

            <h2 id="sushi">Sushi</h2>
            <p class="recipe">
                Let’s dive right in!  It may seem like a lot to buy at first, but most of the ingredients turn into staples [like sriracha + sesame seeds] and non perishables like nori, sushi rice, and vinegar will last a ridiculously long time in your pantry.  You’ll end up with 4-6 sushi dinners for the price of one at a restaurant.  But above all else, it’s really fun!  Invite a few friends over and go nuts.
